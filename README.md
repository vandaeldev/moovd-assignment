# Moovd Assignment

## Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to show the thinking process of the programmer and to demonstrate some of the coding skills needed to work at Moovd.

## Project
>
> Company X wants an application to store the GPS data of their devices and provide insights from this
data. The goal is to provide a login page, an overview page and a detail page.

The project consists of the following components:

- SPA frontend with `Angular v18`;
- `SurrealDB v1.5.3` database server, acting as a [BaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backend_as_a_service).

## Running the code

See the respective `README` files of the [database](/database/README.md) and [frontend](/frontend/README.md) for instructions to run the code.

## Potential improvements/enhancements

- Monorepo workspaces
- Project linting (e.g. ESLint)
- Code formatter (e.g. Prettier)

> See for improvements/enhancements specific to the [frontend](/frontend/README.md) the README in that folder.
